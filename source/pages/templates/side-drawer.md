It works! =)


## This page was added using the `zx` CLI

```shell
zx add -n templates/side-drawer -l side-drawer
```

Where `-n` is used to specify the path/name of the new page to add, and `-l` to specify the layout template to be used
(from the `./templates/pages/` folder).  

Custom page layouts can be added in the `_inc/layouts` folder.
