title: "Ottawa resident and protester squabble during CNN reporter's interview"
description: "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has issued his most aggressive response yet to the so-called \"Freedom Convoy\" protests, invoking the government's Emergencies Act for the first time to try to end more than two weeks of blockades and demonstrations. The law can temporarily suspend people's freedom of movement or assembly and allows authorities to go after those who financially support the protests. CNN's Paula Newton has more."
